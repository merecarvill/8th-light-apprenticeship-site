In becoming an apprentice at 8th Light, gaining the opportunity to pair program with experienced developers was one of the things that most excited me. During the initial four months or so of my apprenticeship, I've had the opportunity to pair only occasionally - usually for a few hours on Friday afternoons during Waza. Each time has been quite instructive, but often a lot of time is lost in getting familiar with the project at hand, understanding the associated language and workflow, etc.

However, I have now spent the last three or four weeks pairing consistently with another apprentice on a project. Now that that project has come to a close, I am transitioning to my mentor's team and helping with client work for the first time. I will most likely be pairing nonstop as I learn the ropes. In light of that, I thought it was an opportune time to cover pair programming in a post.

Pair programming is a software development practice in which two developers work side-by-side to write code, i.e. the two developers effectively assume the role of a single developer. One person writes code while the other offers constructive input, switching roles frequently - on the order of minutes.

The rationale in support of pair programming is that:

- Pairs write code with fewer bugs.
- Pairs write code with better design.
- Pairing between developers fosters the transfer of useful knowledge between developers - both general programming knowledge and project-specific knowledge.
- Pairing fosters interpersonal connections and social interaction, increasing job satisfaction.

It is also generally acknowledged that pairs will take longer to develop the same amount of code than two developers working independently.

[This](http://collaboration.csc.ncsu.edu/laurie/Papers/XPSardinia.PDF) paper's findings support these assertions, stating:

> "...for a development-time cost of about 15%, pair programming improves design quality, reduces defects, reduces staffing risk, enhances technical skills, improves team communications and is considered more enjoyable at statistically significant levels." (Cockburn & Laurie, 2000)

When discussing the effects of pairing, people often distinguish between pairings of developers of different experience levels - e.g. expert-expert, novice-novice, or expert-novice. There's various differences in pairing dynamic that one can infer based on these permutations. An expert-expert or novice-novice pairing might be less optimal for knowledge transfer than an expert-novice pairing, for example.

I can vouch for a difference in pair programming dynamic depending on developer experience levels based on my anecdotal experience. I've definitely been more inclined towards passivity when pairing with an expert versus another novice. While I'm pretty much guaranteed to learn more when pairing than I would solo, I have also generally learned more from pairing with a craftsperson than I have in sessions with fellow apprentices.

A dynamic I had not anticipated prior to my experiences with pair programming with another apprentice for a prolonged period of time was the effort required to promote a shared understanding of the current task and longer term goals. As the novice in a expert-novice pairing, this has been pretty one-sided - with me as the novice dedicating all of my effort to following what the experienced developer is doing.

When pairing with another apprentice, it is much more of a give-and-take relationship in which both developers have to patiently communicate with one another to maintain that shared context. When tired or mired in a difficult section of code, it was harder than I had anticipated to keep patiently communicating with my pair rather than developing tunnel-vision while attempting to hold on to my own train of thought and follow it to its end.

As I begin consistently pairing with relative experts for the first time, I'm anticipating that I will be learning a lot that would otherwise be rather difficult to pick up on my own. Some things, such as the syntax of a programming language or the implementation of a design pattern, are fairly easy to learn independently and outside of a professional software development environment.

Many other things, I am realizing, are very difficult to internalize without being exposed to other developers and witnessing them at work. These will most likely include development workflow, tool usage, design practices, and business-related process. I'm relatively confident that I'll come out the other side of this experience with a greater understanding of git workflow, TDD best practices, and application-level design. These, along with many other things I cannot anticipate yet.

I'm pretty excited.
