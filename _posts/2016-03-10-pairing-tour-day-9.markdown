Today was my second day of pairing with Ginny. The day contained several relatively small tasks for a couple of different client projects, as well as a handful of meetings and impromptu conversations with other 8th Lighters.

This kind of workflow is typical on the studio maintenance team, I think. I found it interesting to be working in many different domains and projects even over the course of a single day, though I did miss the feeling of working on relatively more complex solutions that allow for more concentrated focus and which entail a greater understanding of the code you're working in.

In the morning we updated a few records in a client's database and then spent a couple hours figuring out how to start using MailGun - a transactional email service - in the client's Rails app.

In the afternoon we worked with another 8th Lighter to refactor a section of another client's application.

Ginny began to feel unwell towards the end of the afternoon, so she went home early and I spent the last hour of the day pairing with Diana - who is the other member of the studio maintenance team.

Diana and I worked on troubleshooting yet another client's web application. She had made some changes to an endpoint (fixing a bug) that broke a some integration tests. It was enjoyable detective work, with incremental progress being made until we finally got the tests passing again right as the workday ended.
