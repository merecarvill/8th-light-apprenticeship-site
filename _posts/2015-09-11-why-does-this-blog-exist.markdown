I'm writing this post because I'll be damned if the answer to that question is "Because I have to." I *do* have to: multiple posts on a weekly basis are a requirement of my apprenticeship. But there are certainly reasons why this is a staple of apprenticeships at 8th Light, and I'd like to devote my first post to unpacking those reasons. So the answer to "Why does this blog exist?" will hopefully follow from "Why blog at all?"

So. Why?

**Blogging practices writing:** Writing well is useful for all sorts of reasons, but I want to focus on one in particular. Writing, at a very abstract level, is a practice that involves making thoughts manifest in concretions that (hopefully) achieve a desired effect. Often, the desired effect is to communicate those original thoughts to a human reader. There's a reason why 'writing' is the verb of choice in the term 'writing software,' however. The process is the same: we think of a design that (hopefully) achieves a desired effect, and we attempt to realize it through the concrete grammar of a programming language. Writing is an essential muscle in sofware development, and it can't be bad to exercise it any way that you can.

**Blogging hones communication:** Communicating well also pays dividends in a number of contexts. One of those contexts is definitely software development. Commercial software is developed by teams, and teams have to communicate to function well. Consider the prevalence of things like client consultations, stand-up meetings, code reviews, pair programming, etc.

**Blogging is communal:** A defining feature of the majority of bloggers is that they are passionate about their subject. Writing your own blog places you within that community, providing the opportunity to learn about its distinguished members and to become known yourself. Relationships you form can result in friendships, career opportunities, new sources of knowledge, and much more.

**Blogging clarifies thoughts:** I like the way that [this article](http://www.sparringmind.com/benefits-of-writing/) puts it:

>"[Blogging] forces ideas to be laid out bare for the thinker to see, where it is much less likely that they will be jumbled up like they are in your head."

Not only that, but your words are ostensibly laid out for *others* to see as well, and it often takes a fair amount of analysis and revision in order to present your thoughts in a way that will make sense to your audience. In this way, blogging forces you to entertain outsider perspectives and to refine your ideas accordingly.

**Blogging shares knowledge:** It's easy to think that it's pointless to share your knowledge, at least on the internet for all to see, unless you're some kind of expert. I'm certainly far more conscious of the gaps in my knowledge and how much less I know than the people around me, than I am conscious of the knowledge I do possess. And that's a selfish mindset - all about what I need to be learning, as opposed to what I know right now that could benefit others in their quest for knowledge. I think that allowing myself to remain in this mindset amounts to choosing the selfish option in the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma) - if everyone thinks this way, we all lose out. Everyone's opportunities for learning are far richer if we all take time to meditate on what we *do* know and share it openly with others.

**Blogging archives thoughts:** Memory fades, words don't. 'nuff said.

**Blogging cultivates a learning mindset:** This is not something I had initially considered about blogging, and it's something I find quite exciting to contemplate. [This article](http://www.sparringmind.com/benefits-of-writing/) has another good quote that I think captures the mindset that blogging can instill:

>"Thereâ€™s a certain discipline required to create interesting written work that demands the individual be receptive and focused on finding new sources of information, inspiration, and insight."

In this way, being in the habit of sharing what you learn with others can be a valuable tool for your own learning - fostering a heightened awareness of new sources of information and encouraging the continual analysis and association of incoming information into a presentable, and therefore more cohesive, framework of knowledge.

**Blogging opens you to criticism:** This is another aspect of blogging that I hadn't fully considered. So long as your thoughts remain solely in your head, noone can challenge them. This may be a comfortable position to be in, but the root of all learning is first realizing what you don't know. And - lucky us - most people are overjoyed to provide us the service of pointing out where we've gotten something terribly wrong. So, blogging may be just one way of doing it, but opening your thoughts up to criticism is pretty much essential to learning - at least learning something well - and that alone justifies blogging to me as a worthwhile endeavor.

**Blogging can be fulfilling:** I think it's telling that this wound up at the bottom of my list. I'm not sure I'm going to find blogging particularly enjoyable. But, notice I said 'fulfilling' rather than 'fun.' After conducting the research and thought necessary to write this post, I can confidently say that I'll find the process of blogging fulfilling. Learning software craftsmanship is my mission right now, and I'm sold that blogging can be instrumental in that process. And if I manage to share useful information with others, join a community of passionate peers, or even just scratch that itch we all have as humans to connect and communicate with others - well, sweet.
