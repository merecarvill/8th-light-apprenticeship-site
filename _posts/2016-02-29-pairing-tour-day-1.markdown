Today is the first day of my pairing tour - a staple of 8th Light apprenticeships. My apprenticeship will be over in four weeks, and my candidacy for becoming a software craftsperson will be judged by a panel of eight 8th Lighters.

This week and the next are my opportunity to work alongside each of them and to demonstrate the skills and attitude I've cultivated over the past several months.

I've enjoyed spending the last month pairing on client work, so I'm happy to have the opportunity to work on more client applications and to continue learning from working alongside new people.

Today I paired with Mike D on some iOS and some Clojure backend work. One priority that I had in mind was to be better at communicating my activities to my pair partner throughout the day. My mentor brought up what he called the "Where is Spencer?" phenomenon, in which I'd occasionally disappear for a while during a pairing session.

What often occurred was that I'd get up to get some coffee and then I'd realize a new pot needed brewing. Or snacks/drinks might need stocking, trash might need to be collected, the internet might need troubleshooting, a monitor might need to be set up, a loaned computer might need to be inventoried, a random adaptor might need to be found for a coworker, office supplies might need unpacking - you get the idea.

The solution today was to delegate the tasks that I saw that needed doing, and to make clear to my pair when and what I planned to do as soon as I knew myself. All in all, I think it worked quite well. Mike and I took our lunches and a couple short breaks in sync, and we spent almost no time working without the other being present.

I was grateful that I'd gotten some experience with vim in the past couple of weeks, which allowed me to work pretty fluidly on Mike's computer. I'd also worked with iOS and Clojure at various points in my apprenticeship, so I wasn't really lost there.

I think I was able to be helpful doing one of my favorite things as a pair, which is to actively Google things and suggest solutions while my pair is troubleshooting code. I think one mind trawling the code and another mind trawling Stack Overflow threads for a solution is a pretty great combination.

Specifically, we attempted to update the iOS app in the app store, only to face a host of certificate errors. It was pretty unclear what the problem was initially, but a bit of Googling revealed that Apple's certificate used to sign software for Apple devices had expired the previous week. Just a bit more Googling was necessary to find a solution.

We also ping-ponged on the Clojure backend for a web app. It was easy stuff, but it was a relief to feel completely comfortable trading back and forth with Mike. I mostly focused on getting tests to pass, but I did write one test myself.

All in all it was refreshing to work with a new craftsperson and to work on a new app. I'd long heard about the app within 8th Light, so it was nice to finally learn some of the nuances of the problems it solves and to delve a bit into the code.
