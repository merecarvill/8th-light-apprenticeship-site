I discovered a series of posts on testing by Randy Coulman called *[Getting Testy](http://randycoulman.com/blog/categories/getting-testy/)*. It covers all sorts of great stuff - from the history and various philosophies of testing in software development to effective strategies for adapting tests to accomodate external services. I highly reccommend all of the posts in the series.
