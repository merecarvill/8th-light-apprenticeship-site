Not too long ago, I discovered a game called [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com/). It's a computer game in which one player sits at the computer and attempts to defuse a bomb composed of several modular puzzles that must be solved. Any number of other players help the bomb defuser by consulting a 23-page [manual](http://www.bombmanual.com/) that contains the complicated instructions for solving each module. The defuser cannot consult the manual, and the helpers are not allowed to see the bomb.

## Background

A friend and I played through the majority of the different challenges in the game, which present increasingly difficult bombs as you progress. We had a lot of fun. For me, part of this stemmed from a satisfying evolution that ocurred in the communication between me and my friend as we grew more experienced at defusing the bombs together.

The first time we would encounter a new puzzle module on a bomb, we would be a mess. We had to learn how it worked, the optimal roles for each of us to play in solving it as helper and defuser, what the salient information was for each of us to know, and the best way to communicate that information to one another. And we had to work this out with a bomb ticking rapidly towards explosion and where each mistake accelerated the approach of our demise. It was stressful, to be sure. It also led to a great feeling after we gained experience and learned to solve the puzzle as a cohesive and effective unit.

## Team-building and communication exercise

I wanted to share the experience - it ocurred to me that the game might be a fun exercise to work on communication skills and teamwork with my coworkers. Developing software on teams often occurs under pressure and in situations with significant uncertainty and lots of new information to absorb. I printed out half a dozen manuals and scheduled the exercise for Waza of the upcoming week.

When the time came, a handful of coworkers and I worked through the first couple of challenges over the course of half an hour. Everyone enjoyed the experience, and I saw the same evolution of mutual understanding and communication between my coworkes as we progressed. We had some close calls - with the bomb sucessfully defused seconds away from exploding - as well as some abject failures. On a few occasaions, an individual was able to distinguish themselves by sharing an insight or catching a mistake before it was made.

Everyone involved told me they enjoyed the experience. I'm hopeful that playing the game also led to increased cameraderie and a greater awareness of the challenges of effective communication amidst novel information and while under pressure. I hope to host the event again in the future, next time with some additional elements that will garner more feedback from participants about their experiences and will increase the likelihood that participants will be able to apply their experience to realize benefits in communication and teamwork among their teams at work.

## Future ideas

I have a number of ideas on how I would like to expand upon playing Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes as an event to improve workplace communication and teamwork.

Foremost, I'd like to conclude the event with a discussion amongst participants where each responds to these three prompts:

- Based off of your experience playing the game, what do you most need to improve regarding cooperation/communication?
- Describe a time during the game that another participant demonstrated great cooperation/communication.
- What is one way that your experience playing the game relates to your experience at work.

Also, inspired the constraints placed on individual coding sessions at coderetreats, I have thought of a number of additional constraints that could be placed upon participants when defusing a bomb that could stretch their cooperation/communication abilities further and could promote thought about particular aspects of cooperation/communication. Only one constraint would be applied at any time, and a discussion of the effects of the constraint might follow after the bomb defusal.

The potential constraints are:

- The defuser cannot speak freely - they may only answer questions from the helpers
- Nobody may talk at the same time, or helpers must take turns to speak according to a predesignated order
- Helpers may not talk to one another
- Helpers are only given subsections of the manual, or helpers must share a single manual
- Participants must defuse multiple bombs simultaneously
- Defusers must switch roles with a helper after each bomb module, or every minute
- A lone intermediary must relay all communication between defuser and helpers
- All participants must communicate via writing
- Two participants act as the defuser - one is allowed to speak, and the other is allowed to manipulate the bomb

I'm hoping to develop this into an exercise that will prove to be a fun and fruitful exercise at work. I look forward to contemplating the effects of these extension after I lead another event of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.

NB: I'm not affiliated with the makers of Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, and I'm not under any incentive to write about the game aside from being a fan.
