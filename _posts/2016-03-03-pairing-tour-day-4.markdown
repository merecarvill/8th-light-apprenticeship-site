I paired with Ginny today. She works on our studio maintenance team. The maintenance team provides bug-fixes and continued support to projects that 8th Light has helped to develop previously.

This means Ginny and I worked on relatively small tasks for two clients throughout the day. We also attended several meetings concerning those clients and others as well. This involved a lot of context-switching and interruptions throughout the day.

One of the things we worked on was developing a small JavaScript app from scratch. This app was supposed to be integrated into an app dashboard belonging to another client - the client project I had worked on previously a fair amount during the client.

So, I was able to be relatively helpful there. Ginny hadn't worked with JavaScript in ages, or with Travis CI at all, and probably not with Testem or CoffeeScript, so I was able to help smooth over the inevitable annoyances that come with starting a project with new and unfamiliar components.

We also did a bit of simple database modification via ActiveRecord. I enjoyed that. Between doing some database work today and some with Ben yesterday, it looks like it comes up a decent amount in everyday work, and its something I really never touched on during my apprenticeship.

That said, I'm not really intimidated by my lack of knowledge there. I'm pretty sure most questions I may run into regarding database operations will be relatively easy to discover through a bit of independent Googling. Database related workflow and best practices for designing data persistence are another matter, but I'm hoping I'll have more time to pick that up from working with other developers before I encounter any serious or important decisions there.
