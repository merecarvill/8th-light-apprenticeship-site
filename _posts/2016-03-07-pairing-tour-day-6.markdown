My mentor Aaron and I paired again today. This time we put together the beginning of a project in C# using ASP.NET MVC and Web API. This project will be the backend for the TypeScript project we worked on the other day.

We had practically no experience with the .NET stack, so the day consisted of a fair amount of Googling terms, reading 'getting started' guides, and referring to the git history of another project with a similar setup.

The day was another opportunity to get more familiar with the 1,000,001 things that often seem to intervene between a programmer and actually writing appreciable amounts of code. And, while it was somewhat exhausting and tedious, it was also rewarding.

Having to start a task with little of the necessary knowledge is an unavoidable thing, I think. I imagine it will happen especially often at this point in my career, where I have yet to learn a lot of things.

It's a demoralizing prospect. But today has given me a little more confidence for when the time comes again, most likely without nearly as much assistance next time.

It was valuable to see that even for Aaron - who knows tons more than me and who is pretty damn smart - the process of getting stuff done amid near complete ignorance may not be particularly quick, fun, or easy, but in the end can be done.

And in the end, you come out of it not quite as ignorant. I now know incrementally more about the .NET framework ecosystem.

More importantly though, I think I've learned a bit more about how to work efficiently in spite of ignorance and how to efficiently replace that ignorance with knowledge.
