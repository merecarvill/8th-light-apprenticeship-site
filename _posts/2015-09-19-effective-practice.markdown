I recently finished Uncle Bob's *Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers*. It's given me plenty of food for thought, not least about the value of practice for the professional developer. I thought I'd make a post about the ways we can structure practice to make it as effective as possible.

### What makes practice effective?

Dave Thomas, co-author of *The Pragmatic Programmer*, touches on a number of important elements distinguishing quality practice on his site in the process of introducing [Code Katas](http://codekata.com/):

> What makes a good practice session? You need time without interruptions, and a simple thing you want to try. You need to try it as many times as it takes, and be comfortable making mistakes. You need to look for feedback each time so you can work to improve. There needs to be no pressure: this is why it is hard to practice in a project environment.

I'll unpack his points one by one. Effective practice is:

- **Focused:** The primary focus of your activity must must be on improvement. Allowing yourself to be interrupted or splitting your efforts according to multiple concerns (such as shipping a finished product) can only detract from the overall time and effort spent on improving your skills.
- **Repeatable:** Few things can be learned well on the first try. The best practice can be repeated until a skill is mastered, and then repeated even more to maintain that mastery. One of the powers of an iterative process is the ability to focus on improving a few select variables each time - in this way, ease of repetition also lends itself to an increased ability to conduct *focused* practice.
- **Decipherable:** Feedback is essential to the learning process - from first determining the gap in your knowledge or ability, all the way to knowing when that gap has been sucessfully been filled. The easier it is to identify the cause of your success or failure, the more effective you will be at replicating those successes and eliminating those failures.
- **Directed:** You have to want to practice and you have to possess a clear idea of what it is you want to practice. It could be a happy accident that some activity happens to make you better at something. It is very difficult, however, to conduct focused practice that produces clear, useful feedback - that is, effective practice - unless that activity is designed and conducted with the specific intent for a particular improvement to occur.

### Deliberate practice

Dave's conception of what makes practice effective finds support in psychologist K. Anders Ericsson's concept of [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice). In analyzing what distinguishes experts from ordinary individuals, he maintains that mastery is, foremost, a result of quality of practice; secondarily, a result of quanitity of practice; and, least of all, a result of innate ability. Ericsson's criteria for high quality practice mirror those of Thomas. The practice that makes an expert is "intentional, aimed at improving performance, designed for your current skill level, combined with immediate feedback and [is] repetitious."[[1](http://expertenough.com/1423/deliberate-practice)]

### Takeway

My personal thoughts on this are that I need to be especially mindful about my activities in the context of my apprenticeship. It is easy to accept and complete assignments uncritically - trusting that they have been designed by my mentors to be maximally enducational, and that, in any case, I know so little that it's basically impossible for me not to learn *something*. From what I've explored here, however, I realize that it is incumbent on me to be keenly aware of and focused on what any given activity is intended to improve. Only with this knowledge and mindful intent can I be focused in my practice or properly understand and respond to the feedback I obtain. In highlighting my personal responsibility, however, I don't want to downplay the benefit of having a mentor. They are, of course, tremendously helpful: tailoring practice to the appropriate skill-level, identifing and designing activities with a clear and useful focus, and contributing feedback.

In my next post, I plan to examine some of the established methods of practicing software development that I have come across so far in my apprenticeship.
