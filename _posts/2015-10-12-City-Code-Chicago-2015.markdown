The first [City Code Chicago](http://chicago.citycode.io/) conference ocurred Friday of last week. Garrett Smith spearheaded its organization, creating a focused and intimate event conducted from Second City's theater stage. All of the conference's talks are viewable on youtube. However, they are rather hard to find, so I thought I'd provide some links here:

- [Lambdas and a List of Cats: Test-Driving Lambdas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oq9M1YGpDVI&index=1&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Corey Haines
- [Programming's Greatest Hits from the 60s and 70s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grOC9JixZyQ&index=2&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Michelle Brush
- [In Search of the Perfect Abstraction for My Web App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20MyTr7hwCk&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL&index=3), Irina Guberman
- [The Refreshingly Rewarding Realm of Research Papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eRx5Wo3xYA&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL&index=4), Sean Cribbs
- [Grace Hopper: The Original Pirate Hacker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEC30qhXPp0&index=5&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Melissa Pierce
- [Rainbows and Unikernels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUvNths_5RA&index=6&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Garrett Smith
- [The Adventures of printf: A Short Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWdqtMdcNkE&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL&index=7), Fred Hebert
- [The Neutrino Monologues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZ7Z28XRskc&index=8&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Dr. Deborah Harris
- [Getting Uphill on a Candle: Crushed Spines, Detached Retinas and One Small Step](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lMYbkqPWFE&index=9&list=PLRZRfSIQPttlKS34XMF4e_MMfEisvqdjL), Brian Troutwine

All of the talks were phenomenal. Haines' talk helped to demystify lambda calculus for me, and even piqued my curiosity to learn more. Troutwine's talk was incredibly engaging - detailing the fascinating history of aeronautics research from the seminal work of the Wright Brothers to the first space shuttle launch in 1981. Michelle Brush reminded me of my sadly lacking knowledge of algorithms and inspired me to learn more about the ones that she mentions in her talk.

I'm looking forward to attending next year's event already.
