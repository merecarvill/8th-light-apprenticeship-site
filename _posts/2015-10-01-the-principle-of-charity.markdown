One of the things that led me to want to become a software developer is that, in many cases at least, the job entails pretty extensive interaction with other people. In [The Clean Coder](http://www.amazon.com/The-Clean-Coder-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073), Uncle Bob says that "Programming is all about working with people. We need to work with our business, and we need to work with each other." Working directly with business clients and frequent pair programming is an extreme example, such as you'd find at a consultancy like 8th Light. I recently came across something called the *Principle of Charity* that strikes me as a potentially valuable tool in our interactions with others.

### Core concept

The principle of charity is a methodology in philosophy and rhetoric for reasoning about assertions made by others. It requires that we first consider the strongest possible rational interpretation of a speaker's statement before formulating a response.

This [site](http://philosophy.lander.edu/oriental/charity.html) offers a usefule outline of what the principle of charity entails:

> 1. While suspending our own beliefs, we seek a sympathetic understanding of the new idea or ideas.
> 2. We assume for the moment the new ideas are true even if our initial reaction is to disagree; we seek to tolerate ambiguity for the larger aim of understanding ideas which might prove useful and helpful..
> 3. Emphasis is placed on seeking to understand rather than on seeking contradictions or difficulties.
> 4. We seek to understand the ideas in their most persuasive form and actively attempt to resolve contradictions.  If more than one view is presented, we choose the one that appears the most cogent.

This doesn't preclude disagreement. You will, however, have to temporarily put beliefs, prior judgements, and pre-formed responses aside and to pit your eventual reply against the best (i.e. the most charitable) interpretation you can give to a speaker's assertions. One caveat is that your interpretation should still be one that the speaker would agree with - the principle of charity is not an exercise aimed at molding any given assertion so that they conform to your beliefs.

### Potential benefits

At baseline, following the principle of charity is intended to "avoid attributing irrationality, logical fallacies or falsehoods to the others' statements, when a coherent, rational interpretation of the statements is available."([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity)) This really serves your best interest in addition to the speaker, since we lose out on valuable, potentially valid information and perspective if we mistakenly dismiss valid statements.

This principle can also serve as a guide to keeping our interactions with others helpful and respectful. It can be frustrating when a speaker fails to articulate an idea well. It often requires the listener to make significant mental effort to clarify the idea or to bring it to completion. The temptation can be to direct a response at the mistakes made by the speaker, even when those mistakes aren't essential to the validity of the idea at hand. The principle of charity checks this gut response, and saves us from the temptation toward unhelpful criticism or favoring tangents over useful discussion.

Last, I think following the principle of charity can encourage more extensive and nuanced dialogue when communicating. The principle requires that the speaker agree with our interpretation of their statement. The best way to ascertain this is to ask! So, whenever we find ourselves mentally contributing to the interpretation of a speaker's statements, it invites us to check our understanding with the speaker. This sort of back-and-forth supports the iterative progression of a shared understanding in a conversation, rather than the common pitfall of a conversation progressing along divergent tracks of understanding in the minds of those involved.
