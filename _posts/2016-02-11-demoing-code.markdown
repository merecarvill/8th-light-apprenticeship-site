Turns out demonstrating software is important. I've been relatively slow to realize that in my apprenticeship. My initial experiences talking about my code and showing what I'd accomplished was a low-key affair between me and my mentors. 8th Light is a consultancy, however, and effectively demoing the software features that clients are paying for is fundamental to the success of the company.

My mentors have gradually upped the realism of our demo meetings. Assuming the role of clients, they expect a comprehensive and engaging presentation of the work I've completed. The presentation must hit the right balance of detail without getting bogged down in technical detail. I also have to account for any work that I wasn't able to complete in time.

It took a while to internalize these expectations - there's little formality between my mentors and I at other times and I often found myself lapsing into a conversational dynamic during demos.

The criteria for a good demo finally clicked for me when 8th Light's CEO sat in on a demo I was presenting along with another apprentice. He told us upfront that he thought our demo was terrible. He then walked over to a whiteboard and drew out for us in simple terms the kind of demo that would impress him:

Describe the stories (features) that we had committed to, demonstrate the ones we completed, and give a brief, no-excuses explanation for any we were unable to complete. Make eye contact, direct our speech to the audience, mention all the relevant details and nothing more, and ask for questions after demonstrating each large feature or group of smaller features.

It's simple advice, but I'm grateful to him for taking the time to relay it to us along with his criticism. It also took a significant amount of time and effort to rehearse our next demo until it achieved those criteria. From that point on, I've had a better appreciation of the effort and skill required to effectively showcase work to a client.

I've also gained experience with a popular - at 8th Light at least - method of presenting software with a partner, which was very helpful in demonstrations of a project that I developed with another apprentice. When two people are demoing, it can be helpful to divide the work into the roles of speaker and driver. The speaker stands and addresses the audience and the driver synchronously showcases the feature on the computer or other device. As the speaker addresses any given detail, the driver draws attention to that detail through their interactions with the software.

I've still got a lot left to learn - not least because I have yet to carry off a demo with actual clients in the audience. I'm glad to have become aware of one of the not-strictly-related-to-programming skills that I believe will be necessary to become a well-rounded developer.
