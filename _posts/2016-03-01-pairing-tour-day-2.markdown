Today I paired with my mentor, Eric. It was an unconventional day, since it was almost entirely spent remotely attending a client Iteration Planning Meeting with him.

This was deliberate, though. This was the client whose projects I have been pairing with craftspeople on for the past few weeks. Eric wanted me to have a better look at the logistical side of agile software development - demos to higher-ups in the organization, writing and estimating stories, an iteration retrospective, etc.

The demo part of the IPM was over rather quickly. It was informative to watch the team's project manager walk the stakeholders through the new features that the team had implemented. He avoided being overly technical and addressed things instead in terms of their contributions to business value.

Story planning and estimation took up the majority of the IPM. The meat of the next iteration focused around additions to an app's queue system for receiving and assigning tasks to a set of employees at the client.

One of the major decisions made about which features that the team brought into the iteration was based on concerns about sequential dependencies between stories - i.e. stories that depend on the completion of another story before they can be started. The team decided to leave a number of such dependent stories for the following iteration, rather than risk having work stalled as some developers wait for a particular story to be finished before starting on another their own.

Estimation of stories proceeded with the discussion of a story's requirements and acceptance criteria, and any anticipated complexity in its implementation. Each member then gave their rough estimate of the story's complexity/difficulty in relatively arbitrary point units. Eric said they corresponded roughly to half a day's work, not unlike the points commonly used for estimation at 8th Light - so a 2-point story would take approximately one day for one person to complete.

Eric kept a balance to his participation throughout estimation. He'd mostly keep pretty quiet in discussions unless a question was raised that he was the most qualified person to answer or if an issue was raised that he had particularly strong opinions about.

A debate about the relative importance of preserving backwards compatibility versus improving the API of a handful of client-owned submodules used in many of the client's apps definitely got Eric speaking pretty forcefully. He definitely favored improving the submodules, and there was not insignificant support for the other position among the rest of the team.

I'd say Eric argued his position well, though it didn't seem like a resolution was reached before the team discussion moved on.
